# ImgLib
Provides a simple bitmap class that can load bitmap files into memory and save them back to a file. The bitmap class exposes the pixel data that be manipulated as desired.

This is not meant to be a full-featured image library. It is something I created as a personal exercise and out of my own curiosity of the bitmap file format.

I used this site to learn how the bitmap file format works: http://www.dragonwins.com/domains/getteched/bmp/bmpfileformat.htm
